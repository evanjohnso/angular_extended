## Friday morning <a name="friday-morning"></a>
Spent the morning finishing NetNinja's Angular 2 tutorial, and this absolutely hilarious gentleman's video.

* This led me to component lifecycle hooks:

And the Angular Material Components framework
(going to try and implement this into next weeks project)

I spent an abnormal amount of time on public transport making my way out to Hillsboro to get my car from the mechanic, but was able to finish Cloudability's book on managing and optimizing AWS for clients.

I spend most of my free time doing HackReactor questions and complimenting Epicoder's curriculum with the coursework for the other program I do, Rithim School. Additionally I have a book about DevOps I'm reading in order to learn more about the bigger picture of company structure and the development process.

## Saturday Afternoon <a name="saturday-afternoon"></a>
Met with team at Epicodus to hash out an outline and trello board for the upcoming week. Used BDD to create user stories. No code, only conceptual talk.


* Read articles on Git branching and workflows as well as take Rithim School's module on Git to feel more comfortable and confident with the steps to take.

* Read two chapters of my DevOps book

## Sunday Funday <a name="sunday-funday"></a>
* Erased this entire file by accident and overwrote it with multiple commits.

* Was able to successfully restore state from a previous commit

* Successfully added aliases to my local .gitconfig to streamline repetitive commands.

* Added SSH key to my local machine and linked it with remote GitHub repository. No longer need to authenticate username/password for every push on my local computer.

* Continue the quest to understand cryptocurrency and the blockchain
