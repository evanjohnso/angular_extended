personal development day

Spent the morning finishing NetNinja's Angular 2 tutorial, and this absolutely hilarious gentleman's video.

This led me to component lifecycle hooks:

And the Angular Material Components framework

* going to try and implement this into next weeks project

I spent an abnormal amount of time on public transport making my way out to Hillsboro to get my car from the mechanic, but was able to finish Portland's tech companies do.

I spend most of my free time doing HackReactor questions and going through the curriculum for the other program I do, Rithim School.


Before I enrolled in Epicodus I went to tech meetups, called recruitors, and reached out to the one person I know from college who works as a software developer. I wanted to know what is this coding bootcamp? Is it a scam? Sounds too good to be true. Have you heard of Epicodus? Ever hired their graduates? 

The overwhelming concensus? The graduates are a complete mixed bag. You get what you put in. It's a boot camp, it's not even basic training. You aren't a marine after boot camp, but you're eligible to make the next step.  

Over the past two weeks I've been working on my personal brand and crafting my story

I have a unconventional background, not only for tech, but for most people my age. I struggle with how to represent my past on LinkedIn, resume, and in person.
